prefetch_collection.py — batch-populate the PDF text cache for every attachment
in a Zotero collection, in ONE write_session, so a subsequent source-verification
pass (comparing a thesis's citations against their sources) reads from cache —
zero new Read/Bash prompts, however many sources are cited.

Built for the "verify a thesis's citations" workflow (grila_evaluare coordination),
but generic: works for any named collection. Pair with adding the folder that
holds the actual PDFs (e.g. a student's own reference folder, for linked
attachments) to `additionalDirectories` in ~/.claude/settings.json — this script
removes the re-extraction cost; that settings entry removes the per-file
permission prompt. Both were needed; neither alone was enough.

CLI:
  python prefetch_collection.py <collection name>
