# PDF text cache (memoize extraction as a Zotero child note)

Re-extracting the same PDF's text on every read is wasted work — the source doesn't change
between reads. `scripts/pdf_text_cache.py` memoizes the extraction as a **child note on the
attachment itself**, keyed to `storageHash`, instead of a parallel cache file: it travels with
the library, needs no separate directory, and invalidates automatically when the PDF file
changes (a new `storageHash` no longer matches the one recorded in the note).

## The two-step pattern — check first, don't close Zotero on a hit

The actual efficiency win is **not just** "don't re-extract" — it's "don't force a close/reopen
cycle to find out whether you need to." `get_cached()` is read-only and works with Zotero left
open; only fall through to a closed `write_session` on an actual miss:

```python
import pdf_text_cache, zot

text = pdf_text_cache.get_cached(attachment_key)          # read-only — Zotero can stay open
if text is None:                                          # miss: NOW pay the close/reopen cost
    with zot.write_session(f"pdf-text-cache-{attachment_key}") as cur:
        text, _ = pdf_text_cache.ensure_cached(cur, attachment_key, pdf_path)
```

Calling `ensure_cached` inside a fresh `write_session` on every check (skipping the read-only
pre-check) still avoids re-extraction, but needlessly closes Zotero even on a cache hit — always
check `get_cached()` first, and only open the write cycle when it returns `None`.

## Batching many items in one `write_session`: never open a second connection

A batch of `ensure_cached` calls **must** look up each item's existing cache note through the
**same cursor** the `write_session` gave you (`ensure_cached` does this internally, via
`_find_cache_note_cur(cur, ...)`) — never through a fresh `zot._ro()` connection while a write
transaction from an earlier item in the same loop is still open. A real run hit exactly this: 81
items in one `write_session`, every single one failed with `database is locked`, because the
first version of `ensure_cached` looked up existing notes via `_find_cache_note` →
`zot.find_child_notes` → a brand-new `_ro()` connection. That's harmless for a single
stand-alone call (no write has happened yet, so no lock exists) but breaks the moment a second
item's lookup runs while item one's `INSERT` is still uncommitted on the write connection.
**No data was lost** — the session's own `commit()` still "succeeded" as a no-op (nothing had
actually been written), which is how the failure was caught: the reported `pending sync` count
didn't match the number of items processed. One connection, for both reads and writes, for the
whole session — the `get_cached()` stand-alone path is unaffected since it never runs inside an
open write transaction.

## Scans: run the OCR-overlay ask-first flow before this, not instead of it

`extract_pdf_text` pulls whatever text layer the PDF already has — it does **not** OCR anything.
If the attachment is an unprocessed scan, extraction returns near-empty text and caching that is
pointless. Check `ocr_overlay.detect_scan()` first; if it's a scan, run the ask-first OCR-overlay
workflow (`references/ocr-overlay.md`) so the PDF has a real text layer, *then* use this cache on
top of it. The two features compose: overlay makes the scan text-bearing once; the cache makes
every subsequent read of *any* text-bearing PDF (scanned or born-digital) skip re-extraction.

## Cache note format and why it survives Zotero's own rewriting

The note is written as plain text (never HTML — see the zotero-schema.md "Child note" pattern):

```
[zotero-citations:pdf-text-cache]
storageHash: <the attachment's storageHash at extraction time>

--- page 1 ---
<page 1 text>

--- page 2 ---
<page 2 text>
...
```

At Zotero's next startup it wraps this in its own `<div class="zotero-note znv1">`, turning each
line into its own `<p>` (blank lines become `<p>&nbsp;</p>`) — and, separately, substitutes
`&nbsp;` for any run of 2+ consecutive spaces **within** a line, so the HTML doesn't visually
collapse them. `pdf_text_cache._dehtml` reverses both: strips the paragraph tags back to
newlines, unescapes HTML entities, then folds the resulting NBSP (U+00A0) back to a plain space —
without that last step a cached phrase containing a double space would stop substring-matching
the same phrase typed with regular spaces, silently degrading search/verification against the
cached text. `get_cached` and `_parse_cache_note` handle both the as-written (before Zotero's
next restart) and the Zotero-wrapped form transparently — callers never need to know which one
they're reading.

## Updating a stale cache

If a fresh cache note already exists (hash matches), `ensure_cached` reuses it untouched. If one
exists but is **stale** (hash mismatch — the PDF file changed, e.g. after an OCR overlay), it
**overwrites the existing note in place** (`zot.update_note`) rather than creating a second one —
there is never more than one cache note per attachment.

## Helpers used (in `scripts/zot.py`)

- `add_child_note(cur, parent_item_id, note_text)` — general-purpose, not cache-specific: create
  a plain-text child note under any item **or attachment** (Zotero's own PDF-reader sidebar uses
  the same attachment-as-parent mechanism for "add note from annotations").
- `find_child_notes(parent_item_id)` — read-only list of `(noteItemID, key, note_text)`.
- `update_note(cur, note_item_id, note_text)` — overwrite an existing note's content in place.
